# Morb6

A bot that sends "it's morbin time" and the amount of days that have passed since Morbius released every Friday at 5pm UTC.

Why? Because I've always found scheduling scary and I finally overcame this fear by learning about a nearly 50 year old scheduling method called [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
Also, it was funny.
