# Morb6

Configurable Discord Bot that sends "it's morbin time" and the amount of days that have passed since Morbius released every Friday at 5pm UTC.

Why? Because I've always found scheduling scary and I finally overcame this fear by learning about a nearly 50 year old scheduling method called [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
Also, it was funny.
