# Morb6

[hummusaki](https://github.com/Apoc101) and [Phil](https://github.com/Phil-Swift-Furry)

Configurable Discord Bot that sends "it's morbin time" and the amount of days that have passed since Morbius released every Friday at 5pm UTC.

Why? Because I've always wanted to learn about scheduling and I finally had a reason to do it, discovering a nearly 50 year old scheduling method called [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)<br>
also it's a funny project

If, for whatever reason, you want to host your instance of the bot just input the token into the `.env` file, install the required dependencies and then run `bot.py`
