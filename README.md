# Morb6

A bot that sends "it's morbin time" and the amount of days that have passed since Morbius released every Friday at 5pm UTC.

Why? Because I've always found scheduling difficult and I finally overcame this fear by learning a 47-year old scheduling method called [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
Also, it was funny.

No but seriously, check out cron because it's extremely specialized in certain scheduling-dependant situations (where you assume that most of a system's resources are available at a given time)
